# How-to-Gather-and-Visualize-Performance-Stats-for-Akai-MPC-Live-X-and-One

## Overview
The `Akai MPC` (Live, X and One) runs Linux on the 32 bit ARM architecture. As such, we can basically treat it like a `Raspberry Pi` when it comes to collecting stats.

## Requirements
Download the `armv7` bits for `telegraf` from the `influxdata` team at `https://influxdata.com`.  This can run on any USB, SD, etc. on your MPC.

## `TICK` Stack Required
You need at least `InfluxDB` up and running someplace for stats to get sent to.
